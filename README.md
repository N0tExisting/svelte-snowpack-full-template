# Svelte Snowpack full template

> ✨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

### ⚠️ This Template is not yet in a [stable state](https://github.com/N0tExisting/svelte-snowpack-full-template/projects/1) ⚠️

## Creating a new Project

Using npx:

```bash
npx create-snowpack-app <your-app-name> --template svelte-snowpack-full-template
```

or using yarn:

```bash
yarn --emoji true create snowpack-app <your-app-name> --template svelte-snowpack-full-template --use-yarn
```

then `cd` into your directory

```bash
cd <your-app-name>
```

## Available Scripts

### start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open <http://localhost:8080> to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Keep the build bundler plugin _([@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack))_ or switch to [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) in your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
